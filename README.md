## About Project:
The project is an application designed as a tool for managing Boolean functions and optimizations. It includes functionality for binary value manipulation, visualization of function tables, and finding minimal Disjunctive Normal Forms (MDNF) using an algorithmic approach.

### The application includes:
+ Interactive table for Boolean functions and values editing;
+ Input field for specifying the number of variables in a Boolean function;
+ Display of MDNF results in an output field;
+ Control buttons for iterative steps in solving MDNF etc.

## Screenshots:
+ Screenshots to be uploaded soon.

## Features:
+ Allows dynamic table generation based on user input;
+ Supports binary operations and MDNF optimizations;
+ Provides algorithm-driven tracking for minimal expressions;
+ User-friendly interface with highly interactive table views.

## Management:
+ `btnApply` — initializes the Boolean table and function settings based on user input;
+ `pushButton` — steps through and executes the MDNF minimization process;
+ `pushButton_2` — resets specific stages and steps of the optimization;
+ Interactive QTableWidget for value manipulation in real-time.
